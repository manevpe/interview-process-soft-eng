# Overview
This repo describes the interview process that has worked the best for me in finding amazing software engineers.  
It is aimed at smaller companies, which cannot afford an extensive interview process like they have in FAANG and similar companies.
The process tries to be compact and quick, without sacrificing any quality in the candidates.

# Structure
The hiring process consists of the following steps:
<details>
  <summary>1. Candidate Sourcing</summary>

    Usually managed by the Talent Acquision Team or external recruiters.
    Where an Engineering Manager can help:
     - make sure you have a great internal referral program! The best candidates are usually internal referrals, they fit the working culture the best. It is also usually cheaper than external services and can be a tool to improve employee engagement and retention.
     - know what person / role you are looking for. make sure the job description for the open position is written well.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Resume Triaging</summary>

    Time Frame - ~10min.
    Purpose - Do not lose time with candidates that obviously do not fit the profile. Make sure good candidates do not fall between the cracks.
    Audience - Hiring Manager
    Overview - Hopefully, you will get a lot of candidates and you will only be able to meet some of them.
    Guidelines:
    Candidates are filtered, based on their CV / Resume and any other artefacts they have provided - ex. letter of motivation, portfolio, recommendations, etc.
    Notice if work experience matches the requirements for the role.
    Notice how much effort the candidate has put into their CV, is it structured well, are there spelling or other mistakes.
    Check for red flags - ex. job hopping.
    If possible, check the linkedin profile (or other social media that is popular in your country) of the candidate as well.

<details>
  <summary>3. Initiating the Hiring Process</summary>

    Time Frame - ~10min
    Audience - Usually done by the Talent Acquisition team.
    Purpose - Get in touch with the candidate - by email or phone, let them know of our interest to start the hiring process and how it looks like.
    Guidelines:
    The first contact is a good place to make a good impression. Usually when working at a smaller company or a start-up, the company is not well known on the job market and there is not much information out there for the candidates. That is why it is a good idea to have a dedicated place, where candidates can get to know your company better and get familiar with the interview process as well. Furthermore, another thing that makes a great impression on candidates is if you provide them with their personal Applicant Page, where they can track the whole process, get the necessary information about the future steps and get in contact with you if needed.
    During the contact with the candidate, make sure to inquire about timeframes and anything pressing on their end.
    Ask them for availability / send them availability calendar and ask them to book a time slot for the first meeting.

  <summary>4. Role Fit</summary>

    Time Frame - Can be 3 separate 30min meetings or one 90min meeting
    Purpose - Verify that the candidate has the appropriate skills and experience for the role and that they are a good cultural fit for us. Present the company and the role in a good light.
    Audience - Hiring Manager and Talent Acquisition

    4.1 (30mins) - an overview of the company and the position. “Sell” it to the candidate.
    Topics:
     - company overview (ask them what they know about the company - shows how interested they are), and if they got familiar with the info package we sent them
     - product/s and business, clients
     - role overview and responsibilities. What the ideal candidate looks like
     - tech stack and tools
     - agile process and teams overview
     - working culture, home office / remote working policy
     - why work for the Company. Make sure to mention the reasons why you love working at the company.

    If the candidate got familiar with the info package we send them, a lot of this can be skipped.

    Then ask the candidate whether they like what they heard and let them tlk about what kind of a role and challenges they are currently looking for.
    Finish with the candidates motivation for applying and their availability.

    4.2 (30mins) - discussion about the candidate's experience. Ask them to tell you, don’t just go over the CV.
    Focus the conversation on actual experience, not theoretical knowledge.

Prepare and fill in the [Evaluation Form for Role Fit](./evaluation-forms/evaluation-form-role-fit.md).

    4.3 (30mins) - cultural fit - figure out whether the candidate would be a good fit for our team, do they share the same values and goals.
    Lead the meeting as a discussion, about the candidate's preferred culture. Ask questions to understand if they match our core values as a team / company.


    Make sure to leave time for questions (5-10mins) at the end of the interview.
    Finally - give information about our interview process and what they can expect. Confirm expectations (financial, potential start date, etc.).

<details>
  <summary>5. Technical Screen</summary>

    Time Frame - 2 x 45-60min. Can be done in two sessions or in one go.
    Purpose - verify the candidate has the necessary technical skills for the role.
    Audience - Tech lead / Architect / Senior or other team members / Hiring Manager

    5.1 (45-60min) - coding task / pair programming.
    You see the candidate’s way of work - how quickly they work, do they know their tools, like IDE shortcuts and commands, do they get easily distracted, are they quality obsessed, if given a limited time, what would they prefer to get done, etc.
    You see how often they would use google / stack overflow, etc. and how good are they at it.
    You can actually work together on a task and see what this person is like to work with, are they strong opinionated or give in too easily.
    You can ask questions about why they are doing something in a certain way.
    There is almost no way to cheat (like somebody else helping them with a home assignment).

[Evaluation Form Coding Task](./evaluation-forms/evaluation-form-tech-skills-coding-task-be-dev.md)

    5.2 (45-60min) - System Design / Technical Discussion
    Gauge the candidate’s understanding of system design theory and cloud technologies.
    Topics covered - Cloud, DevOps, Databases, Microservices, Intra-service communication, Scalability, High-Availability, API design, Git, anything else of note.
    Prepare topics for discussion in advance.
    Lead the meeting as a discussion, rather than a questionnaire.
    Ask a lot of “Why“ questions. Try to see if the candidate understands the principles behind a given technical concept, not that they know the theoretical definition for it. Ask how they have used it in practice.
    Start from easier questions and go to more complex ones. The idea is to see how far their understanding stretches. Starting with the hard questions can get a good candidate demotivated.
    If you see that a candidate is not experienced in a given topic, switch gears, do not dig deeper. It is ok if they have never used a particular technology, it is more important to understand if they are a technical person, who can learn quickly any new technology.

  <summary>6. Job Offer</summary>

    To reach this stage in the process, the candidate needs to have been given a “Hire” or “Strong Hire“ score on all previous steps. A recommendation for the candidate’s seniority level must have been made.
    The Hiring Manager, together with Talent Acquisition, prepare a job offer and send it to the candidate. Usually 1 week is given for response.

# Guidance for Interviewers
 - Know what the purpose of the interview is and try to stay on track.
 - We value behaviour fit over technical fit - it is easier to teach tech skills, than change someone's behaviour/personality.
 - A min of 2 people for each step in the process is recommended.
 - Taking notes during a meeting - a short evaluation form should be filled in after each step. Be ready with the form before the meeting. Do communicate with the candidate that you are taking notes, especially for in-person meetings.
 - Avoid presenting the company in a bad light. We should always represent ourselves and the company well - even if the candidate is not a good fit for us at the moment, they might recommend us to their friends.
 - At the same time be honest and transparent - we know we are not perfect, but we are constantly improving. The candidates should be aware of our strong and weak points, we don’t want to have surprises (incorrect expectations) if we hire them.
 - Avoid putting the candidate in a bad light. We should aim to find any weak points, but when you do, do not point it out to the candidate or be mean, rather ask if they think they could improve in this area and how.
 - Do not mislead the candidate or ask misleading questions with the purpose to see if they are clever enough to figure it out. This is not ok in our working culture and should not be done in a meeting with candidates.
 - In general, try to act your actual self - we aim to figure out if the candidate is a good fit, so any pretending benefits no one.
 - Start the meeting with a short small talk - a lot of people are nervous when meeting strangers and need a couple minutes to relax. Make sure to introduce yourselves. If the language spoken has a formal / informal variant, ask if it is ok to use the informal one.
 - If there are people, who are new to interviewing, it is completely ok to mention this to the candidate - “This is person X, and they are currently training how to do interviews”.
 - Take notes on what questions the candidate asked - this can reveal a lot about what is important to them, where they have had pains in the past, or how they think in general.
